     AN EVOLUTION OF STYLE
    </li>
    <li>
     Steeped in history, men's fashion is an art form which continues to evolve. Tom Ford's sharp tailoring draws inspiration from 18th century Savile Row sartorialism, whilst Jil Sander's silhouettes are influenced by Japanese minimalism.
    </li>
    <li> 
     Designers such as Lanvin, Valentino and Maison Margiela have remained true to their haute couture heritage by continuing to practice traditional tailoring techniques and immaculate attention to detail, whilst also adapting certain designs for the modern man.
    </li>
    <li> 
     Parisian label Saint Laurent, which pioneered prêt-à-porter luxury in 1961, is now opting for slimline silhouettes and grunge-inspired styles as an irreverent twist to couturier classics.
    </li>
    <li> 
     Merging functionality and supreme quality, labels like Stone Island and A-COLD-WALL* have positioned themselves as modern auteurs of high-performance luxury, creating garments that tell a story with every technical detail and fabric blend.

     Consider all dress codes covered on Mytheresa Men, from black-tie formalities to casual affairs. For evening soirées, turn heads in a sleek tuxedo from Givenchy. Aiming to stand out in a video conference? Vibrantly printed shirts from Jacquemus and Gucci are failproof choices to opt for, especially in warmer weather. When winter comes, brace the cold in heavily padded outerwear from Canada Goose, or a checked wool coat from Dries Van Noten.
